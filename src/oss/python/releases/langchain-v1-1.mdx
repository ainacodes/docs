sidebarTitle: Release notes
---

**LangChain v1.1 focuses on improving agent reliability and flexibility.** This release introduces model profiles, new middleware capabilities, and enhanced type safety for custom middleware implementations.

To upgrade,

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U langchain
```
```bash uv
uv add langchain
```
</CodeGroup>

## Model profiles

Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a `.profile` attribute. These data are derived from the [models.dev](https://github.com/sst/models.dev) project, an open source initiative that provides model capability data, and are augmented with additional fields for purposes of use with LangChain.

See details in the [models](/oss/langchain/models#model-profiles) guide.

### Summarization middleware

The Summarization middleware interface has been updated to support more flexible specification of trigger points for summarization, as well as what context is summarized. These values can vary with model-specific context windows using the model's [profile](/oss/langchain/models#model-profiles).

See details in the [built-in middleware](/oss/langchain/middleware/built-in#summarization) guide.

### Structured output for agents

Support for [ProviderStrategy](/oss/langchain/structured-output#provider-strategy) can now be inferred from a model's [profile](/oss/langchain/models#model-profiles).

See details in the [structured output](/oss/langchain/structured-output) guide.
